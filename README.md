# Simulation-Project-for-Programming-for-Data-Analysis-
This is a project investigating simulation and modeling for the course Programming for Data Analysis. Submitted by James Quintin to Dr. Ian Mcloughlin. 

This project uses a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) to present live code, visualizations and explanations of the investigation. The code is written in the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution package that contains all necessary software to run this notebook.

This project investigates a real-world phenomenon and aims to model or simulate data from the phenomenon. In this project, the hospital acquired infection of MRSA is investigated including its effect on gender  and mortality rates.
